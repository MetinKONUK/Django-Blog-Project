# Django-Blog-Project
 A blog website, using Django as backend.
 This project includes codes from a Udemy Course. I didn't follow the instructor letter-by-letter so might has some different parts.
 Blog is currently served on https://feanor.pythonanywhere.com.
 There is currently an error: Images and other static files are not being loaded if DEBUG = True. Hope will find a way out.
